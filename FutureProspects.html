                Canada is well-known for providing high-quality education at a low cost, with internationally recognised degrees, with over 500,000 international students. 
                Canada is a popular study destination for international students due to its high quality of life, abundant post-study employment opportunities, and immigration options. 
                One of the main reasons students choose to study in Canada is the excellent educational system. A degree from a Canadian university represents trust and excellence. 
                One of the most distinguishing characteristics of Canadian education is its emphasis on research and development. There is no better place for a researcher than Canada. 
                The Canadian government funds medical, telecommunications, agricultural, environmental, and technological research.

                In 2018, the Global Peace Index ranked Canada as the sixth most peaceful country in the world. 
                As an international student, you will have the same rights as a Canadian citizen. 
                Because of unique legislation, Canada allows all international students to work up to 20 hours per week during their semesters and full-time during their summer and winter breaks. 
                Because your study visa is sufficient to help you find part-time work, you will not need a separate work permit to work on campus or as an intern in any company.
